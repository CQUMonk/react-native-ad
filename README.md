# How To Improve Performance

RN use annotations(such as @ReactMethod„ÄÅ @ReactProp) to tackle java modules and view modules. During runtime
RN need to find exported methods and view props by reflection. So this project improve performance by processing
annotations and other works during compile time, and directly invoke methods without frelection.
